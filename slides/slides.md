# Introduction to Biomedical NLP


## Why Biomedical NLP?

- Most of the information out there is in the form of natural language: 
  scientific papers, clinical notes, social media, textbooks, lectures, 
  websites.

## Why Biomedical NLP?

- Most of the information out there is in the form of natural language: 
  scientific papers, clinical notes, social media, textbooks, lectures, 
  websites.
- This information is potentially very useful but cannot readily be used 
  programmatically and be stored in databases, searched, or analyzed.
- As a result this valuable information is "locked into a vault" until a human 
  reads it, structures it and puts it into some database.
- And even when that happens, the scope in which the data can be used is 
  usually limited and chosen by the extractors.
