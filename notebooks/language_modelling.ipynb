However, the evidence supporting liquid biopsy-guided treatment is still limited. This study examined the real-world benefits of osimertinib in patients with tissue or plasma T790M mutations. METHODS: From January 2016 to June 2018, a total of 183 non-small-cell lung cancer patients were enrolled. The presence of the T790M mutation was assessed by either tissue or plasma. The PFS, overall survival, and tumor response rates of the patients were calculated and compared with those of previous clinical trials. RESULTS: T790M mutations were detected in 51.5% of the patients, including 64 of 140 (45.7%) who underwent liquid biopsies and 23 of 29 (79.3%) who underwent tumor biopsies. After excluding those in clinical trials, 46 patients received osimertinib, including 33 with positive plasma and 13 with positive tissue results for T790M mutations. The median PFS was 11.3 months (interquartile range: 5.2-NR) in all the T790M-positive patients and 10.1 months (interquartile range: 5.9-NR) in the plasma T790M-positive patients. The overall survival, meanwhile, was not reached, whereas the one-year survival rate was 66.1% in all the patients and 61.4% in those who were plasma T790M-positive. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 37.8% and 91.9% in all the patients and 34.6% and 92.3% in the plasma T790M-positive group, respectively. Using a Cox proportional hazards regression, we determined that male gender was a poor prognostic factor for PFS. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective real-world analysis, it was determined that both tissue and plasma T790M mutations can be used to guide treatment with osimertinib. Similar disease control rates and survival durations were observed in comparison to those of phase 3 clinical trials.</td>\n",

Herein, we present a case of early-stage SMPNSCLC with T790M and L858R mutations. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old male patient presented to the Thoracic Surgery Department due to a tumor in the right lower lung. The tumor was detected more than 5 years previously during a health examination; however, the patient ignored the problem because the clinician at that time stated that the lesion was highly likely to be benign. Chest computed topography (CT) was ordered and the images showed a well-defined tumor in the right lower lung and a faint nodular lesion over the left lower lung field. A CT-guided biopsy results showed the presence of atypical cells and positive staining of TTF-1 and CK7. Surgical intervention was performed. The right- and left-sided tumors disclosed micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma and acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma, respectively. Both tumors were positive for TTF-1 but negative for ALK and p40. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the right-sided tumor had an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation presenting as point mutation T790M in exon 20, while the left-sided tumor had a point mutation L858R in exon 21 of EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's case suggests that tumors resembling a benign pattern with central calcification may be misdiagnosed. Thus, early screening for lung cancer is important, and intensive efforts to make a diagnosis through surgical resection or biopsies to allow for tailored optimal treatment may be preferential for the best patient outcomes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A de novo single-nucleotide mutation in the EGFR gene can cause the development of lung cancer. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are used for clinical treatment of such lung cancers, but acquired resistance often mitigates their efficacy. Accordingly, monitoring of de novo and acquired nucleotide mutations is essential for clinical treatment of lung cancers with EGFR-TKIs. Previously, we reported that oligoribonucleotide interference-PCR (ORNi-PCR) can accurately and cost-effectively detect single-nucleotide mutations. In this study, we applied ORNi-PCR to simultaneous detection of the de novo L858R and acquired T790M mutations in the EGFR gene in lung cancer cells. First, we established optimal experimental conditions for ORNi-PCR to simultaneously detect the two single-nucleotide mutations in genomic DNA from lung cancer cells. The conditions we established could also be used for ORNi-PCR using complementary DNA reverse-transcribed from extracted RNA. We found that ORNi-PCR could detect lung cancer cells possessing both single-nucleotide mutations among a large number of cells harboring wild-type sequences, even when the cancer cells constituted less than ~0.2% of all cells. Our findings demonstrate that ORNi-PCR can simultaneously detect multiple single-nucleotide mutations in a gene of interest and might therefore be useful for simultaneous detection of EGFR mutations in clinical examinations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>INTRODUCTION: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutation usually respond to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), whereas T790M mutation and exon 20 insertion are frequently resistant to EGFR-TKIs. EGFR mutations other than those above are seldom investigated. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we enrolled NSCLC patients with non-resistant uncommon EGFR mutations, which were defined as mutations other than L858R, exon 19 deletions, exon 20 insertions and T790M. The mutation patterns, clinical data and treatment outcomes were analysed. Patients were classified as gefitinib/erlotinib and afatinib groups according to the EGFR-TKIs received as the first-line therapy. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients were identified (177/1983, 8.9%). Sixty-six patients had more than one EGFR mutation, including those coexisting with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation. In treatment-naive patients with advanced stages (n = 72), the objective response rate was 35.8% for gefitinib/erlotinib group and 60.6% for afatinib group (p = 0.036). In multivariate analysis, no significant differences were found between gefitinib/erlotinib and afatinib groups in median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Brain metastasis at diagnosis was associated with a shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-4.83) and OS (HR = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.41-7.35). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with NSCLC harbouring non-resistant uncommon EGFR mutations, afatinib use as the first-line therapy may provide a better treatment response but no survival benefit, as compared with gefitinib or erlotinib. Brain metastasis at diagnosis is associated with a poor prognosis.</td>\n",

Such compounds can access the majority of dihedral conformations around the bond axis, however most small-molecules bind their target within a narrow range of these available conformations. The remaining accessible conformations can interact with other proteins leading to compound promiscuity. Herein, we leverage atropisomerism to restrict the accessible low energy dihedral conformations available to a promiscuous kinase inhibitor and achieve highly selective and potent inhibitors of the oncogenic target RET kinase. We then evaluate our lead inhibitor against kinases that were predicted to bind compounds in a similar conformational window to RET, discovering a potent inhibitor of drug resistant EGFR mutants including L858R/T790M/C797S EGFR. Leveraging atropisomerism to restrict accessible conformational space should be a generally applicable strategy due to the prevalence of unstable atropisomerism in drug discovery.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Purpose: Drug resistance is a major challenge for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment of lung cancer. Ferumoxytol (FMT) drives macrophage (MPhi) transformation towards a M1-like phenotype and thereby inhibits tumor growth. CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2395 (CpG), a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, is an effective therapeutic agent to induce anticancer immune responses. Herein, the effect of co-administered FMT and CpG on MPhi activation for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was explored. Methods: The mRNA expression levels of M1-like genes in RAW 264.7 MPhi cells stimulated by FMT, CpG and FMT and CpG (FMT/CpG) were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, the effects of FMT/CpG-pretreated MPhi supernatant on apoptosis and proliferation of H1975 cells were detected by flow cytometry, and the expression of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathway in H1975 cells were explored by western blotting. Finally, a H1975 cell xenograft mouse model was used to study the anti-tumor effect of the combination of FMT and CpG in vivo. Results: FMT and CpG synergistically enhanced M1-like gene expression in MPhi, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). FMT/CpG-pretreated MPhi supernatant inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of H1975 cells, accompanied by down-regulation of cell cycle-associated proteins and up-regulation of apoptosis-related proteins. Further studies indicated that the FMT/CpG-pretreated MPhi supernatant suppressed p-EGFR and its downstream AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway in H1975 cells. Furthermore, FMT/CpG suppressed tumor growth in mice accompanied by a decline in the EGFR-positive tumor cell fraction and increased M1 phenotype macrophage infiltration. Conclusion: FMT acted synergistically with CpG to activate MPhi for suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of NSCLC cells via EGFR signaling. Thus, combining FMT and CpG is an effective strategy for the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR(L858R/T790M) mutation.</td>\n",

EGFR-dependent (T790M and C797S mutations) and independent (Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition [MET] gene amplification, Kirsten Rat Sarcoma [KRAS], Phosphatidyl-Inositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic subunit Alpha isoform [PI3KCA], and RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF] gene mutations) mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been evaluated in plasma samples from NSCLC patients using highly sensitive methods (i.e., digital droplet PCR, Next Generation Sequencing), allowing for the switch to other therapies. Therefore, liquid biopsy is a non-invasive method able to detect the molecular dynamic changes that occur under the pressure of treatment, and to capture tumor heterogeneity more efficiently than is allowed by tissue biopsy. This review addresses how liquid biopsy may be used to guide the choice of treatment strategy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.</td>\n",

We compared concordance rate of next generation sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in the detection of the EGFR activating and T790M mutation from plasma ctDNA with diagnostic tissue biopsy-based assays. The second objective was to test whether putative osimertinib resistance associated mutations were detectable from plasma using NGS. METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2017, we prospectively collected plasma samples from patients prior to commencement of second- or third-line osimertinib therapy and upon disease progression, in a single tertiary hospital in South Western Sydney, Australia. Amplicon-based NGS and ddPCR assays were used to detect activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and T790M mutations in 18 plasma samples from nine patients; all patients were required to have tissue biopsies with known EGFR status. RESULTS: High concordance of allelic fractions were seen in matched plasma NGS and ddPCR for activating EGFR mutations and T790M mutations (R(2) = 0.92, P &lt; 0.0001). Using tissue biopsies as reference standard, sensitivity was 100% for NGS and 94% for ddPCR. Several possible osimertinib resistance associated mutations, including PIK3CA, BRAF and TP53 mutations, were detected by NGS in samples upon progression on osimertinib therapy. CONCLUSION: ddPCR assays for EGFR mutations appear to be as sensitive and highly concordant as amplicon-based NGS. NGS has the ability to detect novel resistance mutations.</td>\n",

The value of cfDNA assays in cancer management remains controversial. Methods: In this study, we first evaluated the analytical performance of the ddPCR Lung cfDNA Assay. We next analyzed the concordance of the results with tissue amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) and plasma next-generation sequencing (NGS) genotyping. Finally, we assessed its clinical utility by exploring the association of cfDNA EGFR mutations with metastatic sites and the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs treatment. Results: The ddPCR Lung cfDNA Assay demonstrated a limit of blank of 1 droplet per reaction, an analytical specificity of 100%, and detection limit of 0.05%, 0.05%, and 0.1% for E746_A750del, L858R, and T790M, respectively. With tissue ARMS-PCR as a standard for comparison, the clinical sensitivity and specificity of ddPCR were 62.5% (15/24) and 100% (82/82) for E746_A750del, and 75.0% (15/20) and 94.2% (81/86) for L858R, respectively. The ddPCR showed high concordance with NGS in determining cfDNA EGFR mutations. Patients with bone and/or brain metastasis showed a higher detection rate and mutant abundance of cfDNA EGFR mutations compared to those with other sites of metastasis. Moreover, EGFR-TKIs treatment was effective in patients with sensitive EGFR mutations in either plasma cfDNA or tumor tissue-derived DNA. Conclusions: We validated in this study that the ddPCR Lung cfDNA Assay is reliable for detection of EGFR mutations in lung cancers, in terms of analytical performance, clinical validity and utility.</td>\n",
